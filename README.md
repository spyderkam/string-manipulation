# Automatic Execution of Methods

If you wish to automatically apply the methods of `string_maipulator.py`, simply just execute one of the `run_method.py` scripts. Once any one of them has been ran, a series of questions will be prompted in the terminal's user interface and you can apply the respective method to one or multiple files in a directory. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`run_split_by_lines.py` and `run_divide_by_lines.py` are currently in development.
